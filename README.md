# harmonizer

feature 1:
* put in a song (need to figure out the logistics of this - mp3 file? spotify or apple music and then in app conversion?) and give options for what and how many harmonies the user wants to generate (soprano, alto, tenor, bass, etc.)
* hear all the harmonies together with the melody and also listen to each part seperately
* generate sheet music with all the harmonies

feature 2:
* put in a song with harmonies and be able to listen to each part separately (strip the song into the different voice parts)
* generate sheet music for this one too?
